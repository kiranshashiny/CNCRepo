1 GND
2 Trigger/Input
3 Output
4 Reset and 8 is always connected to '1'
5 Control Voltage = width of the o/p signal can be varied independently or the RC timing ????
6 Threshold/Input as well  ( Pin 2 and 6 )
7 Discharge
8 Vcc Supply
--
4 and 8 are Vcc
1 and 5 are GND

 why is there a capacitor connected to 5 all the time ? What capacity.

3 is the output.

2, 6 and 7 

-
Duty Cycle - Amount of time the signal is ON, Vs the amount of time the signal is OFF.

Output will be HIGH when the capacitor  will be charging from R1 and R2.
Output will be LOW, when the capcitor is discharging from R1 and R2

Replace the R2 w/ a Pot.

What is on Pin 9 of the Welding machine.

What is the pin 1 2 and 3 doing ?

PNP and NPN difference
